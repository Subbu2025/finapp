# Flask Application with Docker

## Overview

This project is a Flask-based web application that has been containerized using Docker. The application serves as a dynamic platform for rendering reports and static content. The containerized application is accessible at [http://sangamsoftsol.com/](http://sangamsoftsol.com/) via AWS Route53.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Rendering**: The application dynamically renders reports using Power BI.
- **Static Pages**: Home and About pages for general information.
- **Containerization**: Built and deployed using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:
1. **Docker**: To build and run the containerized application.
2. **AWS EC2 Instance**: For hosting the application (if deploying to the cloud).
3. **Route53**: For domain name configuration.

## Build and Run the Docker Image

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Subbu2025/finapp.git
cd finapp

2. Build the Docker Image
Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:
docker build -t finapp:v1 .
- finapp:v1: Name and tag of the Docker image.

3. Verify the Docker Image
List all available Docker images:
docker images

4. Run the Docker Container
Start a container using the built image:
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name finapp finapp:v1
- -d: Runs the container in detached mode.
- -p 80:80: Maps port 80 of the host to port 80 of the container.
- --name finapp: Assigns the container a name (finapp).

5. Verify Running Containers
Check if the container is running:
docker ps

## Access the Application
Local Access:
Open a browser and navigate to:
http://localhost

Hosted Access:
If deployed to an EC2 instance and mapped with AWS Route53, access the application at:
http://sangamsoftsol.com/

## Stop and Remove the Container
Stop the Container:
docker stop finapp

Remove the Container:
docker rm finapp

## Future Enhancements
- Optimize Docker Image: Use multi-stage builds to reduce image size.
- CI/CD Integration: Automate image builds and deployments using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- HTTPS Support: Configure SSL/TLS for secure access.
- Scalability: Deploy using Kubernetes for better scalability and management.
